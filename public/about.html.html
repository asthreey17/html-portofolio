<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I am Dessy, living in Sweden. I am a founder of Swedensia and its projects.I am currently pursuing a Master's of digital entrepreneurship in Germany. I have been experienced as a project director for a small education business for almost eight years. While working professionally at the bank for almost six years, I obtained a Master's degree in Management Marketing. My interest in technology inspires me to enhance my insight into the tech world and entrepreneurship. </p>
<p>This year, I will launch my first project in opening e-commerce about Muslim stuff, including fashion, artwork, etc. I encourage small business owners from Indonesia to sell their best products to European markets. I will be delighted to welcome you as a partner in assisting you in expanding your business internationally with no hassle. I can't wait for your participation in this project, and let's succeed together. </p>
<p>See you!</p>
